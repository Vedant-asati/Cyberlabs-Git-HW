   <br><strong>Gasless Transaction</strong> -

   Gasless transactions in Ethereum refer to transactions that don't require the user to pay for the computational resources (gas) needed to execute the transaction on the Ethereum network. These transactions are made possible through techniques such as meta-transactions or relayers, where a third party subsidizes the gas fees on behalf of the user. Gasless transactions offer several advantages, including improved user experience by removing the need for users to hold Ether solely for transaction fees and enabling dApp developers to attract more users by eliminating the barrier of entry posed by gas fees. Additionally, gasless transactions can facilitate various innovative use cases, such as allowing dApps to cover gas fees for their users or enabling transactions on behalf of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring Ether to be present in those accounts. Overall, gasless transactions represent a significant step towards enhancing accessibility and usability within the Ethereum ecosystem.
